# Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts

**Applies to**

- WindowsÂ 10

There are a sigificant number of policy settings available for Windows 10, both as native MDM policies and group policy (ADMX-backed) settings. Some of these can cause issues in certain Windows Autopilot scenarios as a result of how they change the behavior of Windows 10.  If you encounter any of these issues, remove the policy in question to resolve the issue.

<td>When certain <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-devicelock">DeviceLock policies</a>, such as minimum password length and password complexity, or any similar group policy settings, including any that disable auto-logon, are applied to a device, and that device reboots during the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP), the out-of-box experience or user desktop auto-logon could fail unexpectantly.
